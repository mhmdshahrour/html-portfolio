 <h1>The Best Movies According to Mahdi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>
Inception is, without a doubt, one of my favourite movies of all time. Directed by Christopher Nolan, this film delivers a unique blend of mind-bending storytelling, impeccable performances, and stunning visuals that have left a lasting impression on me.</p>
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>That ear-splitting, creeping crescendo intro upon entrance to the island institution is ample reason for a viewer to indulge in this thriller of a spectacle.</p>
<h3>Doctor Strange</h3>
<p>Before this movie, my only real exposure to Doctor Strange was in The Super Hero Squad Show. I really liked the character and his powers, so I was looking forward to a Doctor Strange movie from day 1.</p>
